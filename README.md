This project focuses on the Container Loading Problem (CLP). In this problem, rectangular boxes must be allocated in containers so that the total volume of the used containers is as small as possible. Due to the increasing number of orders shipped worldwide, there is a demand by companies and society for methods to allocate boxes in containers efficiently. When carrying out the loading of boxes, some constraints must be observed, namely: all boxes must be allocated; boxes can not overlap within a container; and boxes should be allocated entirely within the container area. This work proposes two matheuristics for the CLP, based on Relax-and-fix and Local Branching. Both strategies employ a constructive algorithm to produce an initial solution and then perform a local search using a mixed integer programming model. Although the Local Branching, as well as the Relax-and-fix, was able to find a solution until recently unknown to an instance, results indicate that Relax-and-fix it is a more promising method, as it is capable of generating high quality solutions, often equaling the best result known in the literature.
